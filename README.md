# BigAppMusic

Project Description

This Project has been created as an assignment for BigApp Company.

Requirements

The following are the requirements of the project.

Create a Music app with the following features:

1. Load the music from the Apple music app.
2. The player should have next, previous, play, pause and seek functionality.
3. The player should be controllable from control center and lock screen with the same functionality as above.
4. The music should be playable in background.

This application has been developed using Swift 4.0 and Xcode 9. The application has to be tested by connecting to a device as the inbuilt Simulator does not support the Apple Music App.
